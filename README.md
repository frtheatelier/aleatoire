## Purpose
Trying to learn various JS libraries (jQuery, react, etc). Projects included will be pretty basic stuff as I slowly get the hang of things. Folders are categorised based on library used.

## Projects
### [Basic calculator](jQuery/calculator.html)
Basic calculator app that only does basic operations without caring for Order of Operations. done using `jQuery`

### [Random Wikipedia Article Generator](jQuery/random-wiki.html)
Generates `n` number of random wikipedia articles (`n` is capped at 15 for now). used `jQuery` and `ajax`. links are generated one at a time making it a bit slow but it works.

## Notice
Opening the page will show 2 extra links that lead to other projects. This is (admittedly) a temporary solution given glitch.me stopped hosting sites so for now, we're going with this. I have labeled which links lead to glitch projects
