## Purpose
Trying to learn jQuery :") This repo contains beginner jQuery projects for me to practice jQuery syntax and everything else

## Notice
Opening the page will show 2 extra links that lead to other projects. This is (admittedly) a temporar solution given glitch.me stopped hosting sites so for now, we're going with this. I have labeled which links lead to glitch projects
